# gis_autoadmin

## About
An installable Python Package for administering content on ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise using tags. The central idea of this program is to use properties of content items and groups in order to reduce the work required to properly bring data services into production with ArcGIS. 

## Content Groups
Content groups are an integral part of the GCOOS GIS Network (GGN), and may be considered the dominant organizational unit for the GIS. There are two types of content groups that exist within the GGN: Thematic and Functional. 

### Functional Content Groups
Functional Content Groups are content groups that contain content items that are currently in development, need review, or otherwise do not belong to the PSA account. 

### Thematic Content Groups
Thematic content groups contain content items that are in production. Content items in a Thematic Content Group should be exclusively under the ownership of the PSA or other account suitable for publication.
